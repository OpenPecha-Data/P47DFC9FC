by Kathok Situ Chökyi Gyatso

emaho
Emaho!
di né nub kyi chok rol teng gi cha
In a realm above and to the West,
tuk kyé mönlam lé drup dechen shying
Lies Sukhāvatī, forged through bodhicitta and prayer,
dé ü chomden gönpo öpakmé
In its centre, the blessed Lord Amitābha, 'Boundless Light',
gyalsé khor tsok gyatsö ü na shyuk
Presides amidst a retinue of countless bodhisattvas.
lü ngak yi rap güpé chak tsal shying
Devotedly, with body, speech and mind, I pay homage,
ngö jor yi trul chö bul dik tung shak
I offer real and imagined gifts and confess my harmful acts and downfalls,
gé la yi rang chö khor korwar kul
I rejoice in virtue, and request you to turn the wheel of Dharma,
yun ring shyuk sol gé tsa chang chub ngo
I beseech you to remain, and dedicate all virtue towards enlightenment:
namkhé khyabpé pama semchen kun
May all sentient beings, my very own parents, as infinite as space,
namkhyen dzokpé sangyé tobpar ja
Attain the omniscient state of perfect Buddhahood!
dé chir dak gi dü di né zung té
To this end, from this moment on,
chang chub bar du gyalsé chö la lap
I shall train in the actions of a bodhisattva.
di tsön dü sum sakpé gé tsok kun
With this representing the virtues of past, present and future,
dro nam dzokpé sangyé top chir ngo
I dedicate it so that all beings may attain perfect enlightenment,
de ma tobpé tsé rap tamché du
And, in all their lives until then,
dechen shying kyé gyalwé shyal tong shok
Be born in Sukhāvatī, there to behold the Victorious One!
